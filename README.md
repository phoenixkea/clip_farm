# clip_farm

Seduced by the algorithm and its regenerative slop, I look into clip farming and the rise of   short-form content by inhabiting its dense ecosystem. 

Submitting myself to its exploitative nature, engaging with user metrics, I train an AI model to detect the most clip-able moments from long-format content - with the aim of growing a fully automated farm. 
This project unpicks virality through the lens of AI, questioning how our social platforms have been absorbed into commercial infrastructures and reshaped by algorithmic logic. 

From metrics to clips - to scheduled automation;
The open source accessibility to content pipelines makes clip farming not only possible, but almost necessary for digital survival in late capitalism. 
Anyone can do it - 
easily generating thousands of pounds a month. 
But at what cost? 

Short form media has revolutionised our social landscape keeping us in engagement loops on dopamine driven platforms run by AI automated systems. 
Turning meaning into metrics - corporations are actively capitalising on our digital behaviours. 
Not just analysing culture, but curating its own through regurgitated biased algorithms.

How do we perceive and understand self in this new media reconfiguration? 
This project questions digital ethics within the uprise of Ai automation, unfolding truths about and monetisation of automation and Ai
